# White Label App
This is a white label app designed to help clients improve their testing experience. 
In this case, the app is customized and rebranded for the client to use under their own name.

The purpose of this app is to maintain the IDFV (Identifier for Vendor) of the client so that testing can be consistent across testing iterations.
Moreover, the app can be used while testing the integration with AppsFlyer - that way the IDFV is kept while removing and installing your app over and over again. 

IDFV is a unique identifier that is generated by iOS to track user activity across multiple apps from the same vendor. <br/>By maintaining the IDFV, the client can ensure that user activity is accurately tracked across different versions of the app.
[More info on IDFV](https://www.appsflyer.com/glossary/idfv/)

In order for the IDFV to be changed, the Bundle Identifier of the app must be changed. When the Bundle Identifier is changed, a new IDFV is generated for the app.

## How to provision the app to your use:
To implement the white label app, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repo to your local machine.
2. Open Xcode and select the project in the Project Navigator.
3. Select the target for your app in the Targets section.
4. Click on the "Signing & Capabilities" tab and find the Bundle Identifier field.
5. Change the Bundle Identifier to a new, unique identifier that uses a prefix associated with your company. For example, if your company's bundle IDs start with "com.MyCompany.*", you can add your own prefix to the Bundle Identifier, such as "com.MyCompany.WhiteLabelApp".
6. Rebuild and re-install the app on the device.
Once the app is installed with the new Bundle Identifier, it will have a new IDFV associated with it/ if you have already other apps you developed the new white label app will get the same IDFV as the others. Now by keeping this app, you ensure consistent testing across multiple versions of the app.
